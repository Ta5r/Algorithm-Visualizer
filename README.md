# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
Sorting algorithms visualized in this Visualizer are given below:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Features
- Graphical representation of arrays
- Random generation of arrays to work on
- Speed and size control for better visualization
- Time and Space complexity info given as per algorithm used
- Highly upgradable by adding scripts for new algorithms

## Tech
Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- HTML - to structure a web page and its content
- CSS - to style and layout web page
- JavaScript - to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications

## Installation

Visualizer requires any web browser to run.
To edit and upgrade code, we need a code editor like VSCode.

```sh
double click to open and run "index.html"
generate new array by clicking "generate new array"
can adjust array size or sorting speed by respective selection sliders
click on the desired algorithm to sort the array.
```

## Development

Algorithm Visualizer uses HTML + CSS + JavaScript for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Page Layout or design:

```sh
index.html
style.scss
```

Visualization Styles:

```sh
css/style.css
```

To add more Algorithms:

```sh
scripts/[algo].js
add [algo].js to "index.html"
```
